# Bash

In this lab you will learn how to search your bash commands you did in the past and how you can customize your bash.

## History

```bash
# you can see your bash history in this file
cat ~/.bash_history

# or you can use the history command
history

# you can search the history inline (via clicking again <CTRL>+<R> you can navigate in the history)
<CTRL>+<R>
cat
<CTRL>+<R>
```

# The File `~/.bashrc`

You can change the bash behaviour via inserting valid bash commands into this file. This file gets considered each time you login to a machine. For example you can use it for setting environment variables.
