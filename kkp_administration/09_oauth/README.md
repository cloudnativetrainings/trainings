### Connect KKP to the OIDC Provider

Add the following to the file `values.yaml` in the section `dex`. Do not miss to fill in the missing values.
```yaml
connectors:
  - type: google
    id: google
    name: Google
    config:
      clientID: <CLIENT-ID>
      clientSecret: <CLIENT-SECRET>
      redirectURI: https://<DOMAIN>/dex/callback
      hostedDomains:
        - cloud-native.training
```

Apply the changes
```bash
kubermatic-installer --charts-directory ~/kkp/charts deploy \
    --config ~/kkp/kubermatic.yaml \
    --helm-values ~/kkp/values.yaml
```

Now, after signing out, you can log in with Google. Note that this is a new user which does not have admin permissions.

## Change the role of a user

```bash
kubectl get user

# Change the field `spec.admin` to true
kubectl edit user XXXXX
```

Now you have admin permissions also for this user.
