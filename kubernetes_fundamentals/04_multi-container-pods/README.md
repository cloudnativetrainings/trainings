# Multi Container Pod

In this training, we will work with a Pod which contains 2 containers.

> Navigate to the folder `04_multi-container-pods` from CLI, before you get started.

## Inspect pod-v1.yaml definition file and create the pod

```bash
cat pod-v1.yaml
kubectl create -f pod-v1.yaml
```

## Get the logs of the Pod

```bash
kubectl logs -f my-pod
```

> Pay attention to the first line of the output.

## Exec into the Pod

- Exec into the multi-container pod

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it my-pod -- /bin/sh
  ```

  > Pay attention to the output.

- Find out how to exec into container-b of the Pod

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it my-pod -c container-b -- /bin/sh
  ```

## Share a directory between 2 Containers in a Pod

- Inspect pod-v2.yaml definition file and re-create the pod

  ```bash
  cat pod-v2.yaml
  kubectl replace --force -f pod-v2.yaml
  ```

- Verify the output from container-b

  ```bash
  kubectl logs my-pod -c container-b
  ```

## Cleanup

- Delete the created resource - pod.

  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod my-pod
  ```
