# ReplicaSet

In this training, we will learn about Replicasets.

> Navigate to the folder `05_replicasets` from CLI, before you get started.

## Inspect the replicaset.yaml definition file and create the replicaset

```bash
cat replicaset.yaml
kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml
```

> Find and fix the two issues in there. Note, that you haven't finished this section until the pod of the ReplicaSet is in Running state.

## Take a look at the number of Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## Scale the number of replicas to 3

```bash
kubectl scale replicaset my-replicaset --replicas 3
```

Open second terminal to watch the Pods

```bash
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods
```

## Delete one of the Pods

```bash
kubectl delete pod <POD-NAME>
```

Open second terminal to watch the Pods

```bash
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods
```

## Cleanup

Delete the ReplicaSet

```bash
kubectl delete replicaset my-replicaset
```

Verify if replicaset is delete including all the associated pods

```bash
kubectl get rs,po
```
