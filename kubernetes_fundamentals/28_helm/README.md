# Helm

In this training, we will use Helm to create and customize an application.

> Navigate to the folder `28_helm` from CLI, before you get started.

## Verify if helm is installed

- Check helm

  ```bash
  helm version
  ```

- Ensure autocompletion is installed

  ```bash
  echo 'source <(helm completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc && bash
  ```

## [Optional] Install helm

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

## Do a release

- Show all releases

  ```bash
  helm ls
  ```

- Release with its default values

  ```bash
  helm install my-release-defaults ./my-chart
  ```

- Show all releases

  ```bash
  helm ls
  ```

- Show kubernetes resources

  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

- Delete a release

  ```bash
  helm delete my-release-defaults
  ```

## Do a customized release

- Release with a custom values.yaml file

  ```bash
  helm install my-release-custom ./my-chart -f my-values.yaml
  ```

- Show all installed charts

  ```bash
  helm ls
  ```

- Show kubernetes resources

  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

## Upgrade a release

- Change the color in the file `my-values.yaml` to re-release

  ```bash
  helm upgrade my-release-custom ./my-chart -f my-values.yaml
  ```

- Show all releases

  ```bash
  helm ls
  ```

- Show kubernetes resources

  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

## Templating

- Add templating for the deployment in the file ./my-chart/templates/deployment.yaml

  ```yaml
  spec:
  replicas: { { .Values.replicas } }
  selector:
  ```

## Customize your new release

- Add the replicas to the file my-values.yaml.

  ```yaml
  color: magenta
  replicas: 3
  ```

## Release

- Re-release

  ```bash
  helm upgrade my-release-custom ./my-chart -f my-values.yaml
  ```

- Show all releases

  ```bash
  helm ls
  ```

- Show kubernetes resources

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

## Tips & Tricks

- Render yaml files without deploying them

  ```bash
  helm install my-chart ./my-chart --dry-run > dry.run
  ```

- Lint your charts

  ```bash
  helm lint ./my-chart
  ```

## Cleanup

```bash
helm delete my-release-custom
```
