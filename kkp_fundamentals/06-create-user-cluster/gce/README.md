# Create your first user cluster:

Open and log in to the Kubermatic UI with your training users: `https://kubermatic.YOUR-DNS-ZONE.loodse.training`

## Provisioning

Follow these tutorials to create a project and a user cluster:
- [Kubermatic Docs > Tutorials > Create Project](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/tutorials_howtos/project_and_cluster_management/#:~:text=create%20a%20new%20project)
- [Kubermatic Docs > Tutorials > Create Cluster](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/tutorials_howtos/project_and_cluster_management/#:~:text=create%20cluster)

For the authentication with Google use your already created service account from your [KubeOne - gce/05_create_gce_service_account.md](https://github.com/kubermatic-labs/trainings/tree/kkp-improvement/kkp_fundamentals/01_master_cluster/gce#prepare-secrets) or create a service account as described in our [Kubermatic Docs > Requirements > Cloud Provider > GCP](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/architecture/requirements/support_policy/provider_support_matrix/google_cloud/gcp/).

To add the credentials in the Kubermatic UI, encode it as base64 and copy it:
```bash
cd [training-repo] #kkp_fundamentals
base64 -w 0 ./.secrets/k8c-cluster-provisioner-sa-key.json
```
**IMPORTANT:** Use machine type `n1-standard-2` + Replicas of `1`, so that we don't spend unneeded resources.

During the creation of the user cluster you can watch the status in your `europe-west` seed cluster:
```bash
# get overall cluster status
kubectl get cluster
kubectl describe cluster [cluster-id]
kubectl get cluster [cluster-id] -o

#see the control plane component pods
kubectl get pods -n cluster-[cluster-id]
```

After a few minutes you should see the newly created user cluster. Download the kubeconfig from the UI and connect to it!

Check also the created [GCE - VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances):

## Create HA setup
Per default every Kubermatic user cluster control plane is deployed as an HA setup, so for this you have notating to do :-)

To provide the option of small and big clusters, we think it's best to create the worker nodes based on your needs on compute power and networking. So e.g. to create an HA worker pool spread over 3 availability zones, follow these steps:
1. Open your cluster overview dashboard
2. Create an additional `MachineDeployment` for each missing zone, see [Kubermatic Docs > Tutorials > Machine deployments](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/examples/manage_workers_node/via_ui/). Use machine type `n1-standard-2` + disk type `pd-ssd` + Replicas of `1`, so that we don't spend unneeded resources!
3. Done! Check [GCE - VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) and there you should see `3` VMs spread across 3 zones.  

**NOTE:** To identify the different node pools, you should always set meaningful names, like using the zone name in this example:
![GCE Multizone Setup - Kubermatic](../.pics/gce.k8c.multizone.worker.png)
![GCE Multizone Setup - GCE Console](../.pics/gce.console.multizone.worker.png)

**NOTE:** To manage the nodes by CRD's you can do exactly the same as you learned in [KubeOne Training > gce/30_setup_ha_worker.md](../../kubeone/gce/30_setup_ha_worker.md)


## Upgrade

To upgrade your cluster, you have two options:
1. Trough the UI dashboard: [Kubermatic Docs > Tutorials > Upgrade Cluster](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/tutorials_howtos/project_and_cluster_management/#:~:text=upgrade%20cluster)
2. By updating the `cluster` object trough the CLI:
    - Execute `kubectl edit cluster [cluster-id]`
    - Change the version field:
      ```yaml
        exposeStrategy: NodePort
        humanReadableName: blissful-mclean
        oidc: {}
        pause: false
        version: 1.17.6    <<< CHANGE
      status:
      ```
During the upgrade you can watch the rolling release of the containers control plane:
```
kubectl get pods -n cluster-[cluster-id]
```

## Delete
For the cluster deletion, you have two options:
1. Trough the UI dashboard: [Kubermatic Docs > Tutorials > project_and_cluster_management > Delete Cluster](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/tutorials_howtos/project_and_cluster_management/#:~:text=delete%20cluster)
2. By deleting the `cluster` object trough the CLI:
  - Execute `kubectl delete cluster [cluster-id]`

You will see that:
 - All created worker nodes in your [GCE - VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) page should be removed.
 - Network rules get deleted
 - User Cluster namespace has been deleted `kubectl get ns`
