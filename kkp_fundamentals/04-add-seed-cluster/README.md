# Add Seed Cluster

As we defined in the beginning of the lab, we want to use the current master cluster as seed cluster also, which is called "nested seed" cluster. This mean, we run a combined master and seed setup on single Kubernetes cluster, as this diagram shows:

![Combined Master/Seed Cluster Setup](https://docs.kubermatic.com/img/kubermatic/master/concepts/architecture/combined-master-seed.png)

To read more about this, take a look into our docs: [Kubermatic Docs > Concepts > Architecture](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/architecture/)

To add seed cluster to the Kubermatic master, you need to

1. create **seed-kubeconfig** Secret
2. Create **seed resource**.

## Create `seed-kubeconfig` secret

To connect the seed cluster with the master, you need to create a kubeconfig Secret.

```bash
cd ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/
# create copy of current kubeconfig
cp $KUBECONFIG ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/temp-seed-kubeconfig
```

We need to convert the `temp-seed-kubeconfig` to a Kubernetes secret `seed-kubeconfig`.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic seed-kubeconfig -n kubermatic --from-file kubeconfig=~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/temp-seed-kubeconfig --dry-run=client -o yaml > ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/seed.kubeconfig.secret.yaml
```

Verify that the secret `seed-kubeconfig` has been created correctly by executing the following command and making sure the output looks similar to the example output afterwards:

```bash
cat ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/seed.kubeconfig.secret.yaml
```

```bash
# Output
apiVersion: v1
data:
  kubeconfig: #... base64 encoded string
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: seed-kubeconfig
  namespace: kubermatic
```

If everything looks fine, apply the secret and delete the temp file:

```bash
kubectl apply -n kubermatic -f ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/seed.kubeconfig.secret.yaml
## cleanup
rm ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/temp-seed-kubeconfig
```

---

## Create seed resource

Take a look at the seed configuration file:

```bash
cat ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/04-add-seed-cluster/seed.europe-west.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8s.io/v1
kind: Seed
metadata:
  name: kubermatic
  namespace: kubermatic
spec:
  # reference to the kubeconfig to use when connecting to this seed cluster
  kubeconfig:
    name: seed-kubeconfig   # REFERENCE the secret
    namespace: kubermatic
  ### Seed location
  # Optional: Country of the seed as ISO-3166 two-letter code, e.g. DE or UK.
  # For informational purposes in the Kubermatic dashboard only.
  country: EU
  location: "Frankfurt"
  # Datacenters contains a map of the possible datacenters (DCs) in this seed.
  # Each DC must have a globally unique identifier (i.e. names must be unique
  # across all seeds).
  datacenters:
    #==================================
    #============== GCP ===============
    #==================================
    ### configs the GCE data center of this lab as an available region for the GCP provider
    gce-eu-west-3:
      country: DE
      location: "Frankfurt"
      spec:
        gcp:
          # Region to use, for example "europe-west3", for a full list of regions see
          # https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/
          region: "europe-west3"
          # Optional: Regional clusters spread their resources across multiple availability zones.
          # Refer to the official documentation for more details on this:
          # https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/regional-clusters
          regional: true
          # List of enabled zones, for example [a, c]. See the link above for the available
          # zones in your chosen region.
          zone_suffixes: [a,b,c]
```

Refer to the [Seed CRD documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/tutorials_howtos/project_and_cluster_management/seed_cluster/) for a complete example of the Seed CustomResource and all possible datacenter configurations. We will see additional datacenter examples in a later chapter.

Let's apply the manifest above in the master cluster. Kubermatic will pick up the new Seed and begin to reconcile it by installing the required Kubermatic components (for a nested seed in our case):

**ATTENTION:** If you are using KKP CE version, seed must be named as `kubermatic` instead of `europe-west`.

```bash
# create copy of seed template
cp ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/04-add-seed-cluster/seed.europe-west.yaml ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/
# apply the config change
kubectl apply -n kubermatic -f ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/seed.europe-west.yaml
```

---

## Verify seed deployment

Verify the changes have been applied by the Kubermatic Operator

```bash
kubectl -n kubermatic get deployments,pods
```

``` bash

```

In addition to the pods, dedicated services should have been deployed as well. To ensure the connectivity:

```bash
kubectl -n kubermatic get svc
```

```bash
NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                          AGE

```

**NOTE:** If you encounter errors, take a look at the logs of the deployment `kubermatic-seed-controller-manager`. On success, it should look like this:

```bash
# take a look at both pods of the deployment
kubectl -n kubermatic logs kubermatic-seed-controller-manager-xxxx-xxxx
```

```bash

```

**Note:** Since Kubermatic `2.14` the seed cluster automatically creates the so called [NodePort Proxy]. The NodePort Proxy will expose the containerized control plane components of every user cluster. So please be aware that the endpoint of the service `nodeport-proxy` is reachable for your end users.

To make the user cluster control plane API endpoint(s) workable, the IP address **MUST** match your seed cluster DNS entry `*.SEED_CLUSTER_NAME.kubermatic.YOUR-DNS-ZONE.loodse.training`. Let's set this up in the next chapter:

---

## Optional seed configuration - User cluster etcd backup

Kubermatic performs regular backups of user clusters by snapshotting the etcd of each cluster. By default these backups are stored in any S3 compatible storage location. To demonstrate an on-prem setup, we will use an in-cluster location provided by a PVC. The in-cluster storage is provided by [Minio S3 gateway](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-gateway-for-s3.html) and the accompanying `minio` Helm chart.

### Minio Backup Storage Class `kubermatic-backup`

If your cluster has no default storage class, it's required to configure a class explicitly for Minio. You can check the cluster's storage classes via:

```bash
kubectl get storageclasses
```

```bash
# Output
NAME                        PROVISIONER            AGE
kubermatic-fast             kubernetes.io/gce-pd   6d17h
```

**NOTE:** Minio does not need `kubermatic-fast` because it does not require SSD speeds. A larger HDD is preferred.

So we want to set up a dedicated `kubermatic-backup` storage class. See [`./gce.sc.kubermatic.backup.yaml`](./gce.sc.kubermatic.backup.yaml) and create a copy in your `kkp-setup` folder:

```bash
cp ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/04-add-seed-cluster/gce.sc.kubermatic.backup.yaml ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup
```

Check the configuration. For more details about the storage class parameters of the Google CCM, see [Kubernetes Storage Class - GCE PD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#gce-pd).

```bash
cat ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/gce.sc.kubermatic.backup.yaml
```

When everything looks fine, apply the new storage class:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/src/kkp-setup/gce.sc.kubermatic.backup.yaml
```

Check that you now have a new storage class installed:

```bash
kubectl get sc
```

```bash
NAME                          PROVISIONER            AGE
kubermatic-backup (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd   16m
kubermatic-fast               kubernetes.io/gce-pd   6d17h
```

#### Install `minio` and `s3-exporter`

To configure the storage class and size, extend your `./src/kkp-setup/values.yaml` like so:

```yaml
minio:
  storeSize: '10Gi'
  storageClass: kubermatic-backup
  # access key/secret for the exposed minio S3 gateway
  credentials:
    # access key length should be at least 3 characters
    accessKey: "reoshe9Eiwei2ku5foB6owiva2Sheeth"
    # secret key length should be at least 8 characters
    secretKey: "rooNgohsh4ohJo7aefoofeiTae4poht0cohxua5eithiexu7quieng5ailoosha8"
```

It's also advisable to install the  [S3 Backup Exporter](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/master/charts/s3-exporter) Helm chart, as it provides basic metrics about user cluster backups. Now let us install the charts:

```bash
cd ~/mnt/kkp_fundamentals/
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --wait --values ./src/kkp-setup/values.yaml --namespace minio minio ./src/kkp-setup/releases/v2.17.1/charts/minio
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --wait --values ./src/kkp-setup/values.yaml --namespace kube-system s3-exporter ./src/kkp-setup/releases/v2.17.1/charts/s3-exporter/
```

After that, verify that all components are installed:

```bash
kubectl get pod,pvc -n minio
```

```bash

```

```bash
kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep s3
```

```bash

```
