# Images

In this training, you will learn how to manage images.

## Search for an image

* Check if image is available or not on Docker Hub (default registry for docker images).

```bash
docker search nginx
```

## Download an image

* You can pull an image from Docker Hub using below pull command, which can be used for container creation afterwards. Adjust the image tag to download required version.

```bash
docker pull nginx:1.23.1
```

## List local docker images

* To verify images is available locally, use following command

```bash
docker images
```

## Start a container

* Let's start a container from the downloaded local image in the previous step.

```bash
docker run -d nginx:1.23.1
```

## Remove a local docker image

* Try to remove the local image which was downloaded before.

```bash
docker rmi nginx:1.23.1
```

>This will not work out due to the image is currently in use. You will get Error Message on console, similar to this - 'Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "nginx:1.23.1" (must force) - container xxxxxxxx is using its referenced image xxxxxxxx'

* Remove all running containers

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)
```

> * `-f` option will stop and then remove the running container.
> * The inline command `docker ps -qa` returns the container id of all containers.
If you are running this container on existing environment with existing containers, please provide correct container id, instead of `$(docker ps -qa)`

* Try again to remove the image

```bash
docker rmi nginx:1.23.1
```

>At this time, the docker image will be removed as there is no running container associated to this image.
