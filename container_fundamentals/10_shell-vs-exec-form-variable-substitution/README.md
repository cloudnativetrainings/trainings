# Exec vs Shell form - variable substitution

In this training, you will learn the difference between exec and shell form concerning variable substitution.

>Navigate to the folder `10_shell-vs-exec-form-variable-substitution` from CLI, before you get started.

## Inspect the Dockerfile

```bash
cat Dockerfile
```

> You can see the exec form of `ENTRYPOINT`

## Build the image

```bash
docker build -t shell-vs-exec-form-vars:1.0.0 .
```

## Run a container from the image

```bash
docker run -it shell-vs-exec-form-vars:1.0.0
```

>Note that variable substitution for the environment variable $FOO did not happen.

## Change the entrypoint to the following in the Dockerfile

```docker
ENTRYPOINT /bin/echo $FOO
```

> This is shell form of `ENTRYPOINT`

## Rebuild the image

```bash
docker build -t shell-vs-exec-form-vars:2.0.0 .
```

## Run a container from the new image

```bash
docker run -it shell-vs-exec-form-vars:2.0.0
```

>Note that variable substitution happened this time.

## Cleanup

* Remove all the containers

  ```bash
  docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)
  ```

* Remove all the images

  ```bash
  docker rmi -f $(docker images -qa)
  ```
